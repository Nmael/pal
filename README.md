pal allows convenient visualization of a color palette in conditions where full interpretation of color may not be possible. These conditions include grayscale conversion (e.g., printing using a "black and white" printer) and several forms of color blindness.

Color blindness simulation is performed using the HCIRN Color Blindness Simulation Function. Since HCIRN no longer exists, the function was adapted from a version available from the [jsColorblindSimulator](https://github.com/MaPePeR/jsColorblindSimulator/blob/master/hcirn_colorblind_simulation.js).
